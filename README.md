### 🚨 The Serious Stuff
If you’re curious about the serious stuff — major systems and initiatives I’ve led.

### 🧑🏽‍💻 What I Actually Do
I design and lead teams that build real systems running in production - the kind that power physical infrastructure, handle money, talk to devices, and don't get to "just restart later."

I've spent most of my career working across:
* Mobile platforms (Android)
* Cloud-native microservices
* IoT & telemetry systems
*  ERP integrations
* Data pipelines & analytics
* Distributed engineering teams

I care deeply about systems that:
* Scale without drama
* Survive edge cases
* Are observable before they fail
* Age well

If it touches real-world operations and has business impact, I'm interested.

---

### 🧮 How I Think
* Longevity > quick hacks
* Observability is not optional
* If it’s manual, it will eventually fail
* Architecture is about trade-offs, not ego
* Calm leadership wins in production

### ⚡ Fun Facts & "Offline Mode"
* **Where to find me:** If I'm not at my keyboard, I'm probably on a long drive — the kind where thinking just flows, or hiking the trails (systems are easier to debug after a mountain view).
* **Startups vs. Corporate:** I love the chaos of startups, but I love the discipline of clean architecture even more.
* **Current Read:** Deep diving into Human Psychology and Economics. 
* **Weirdest Bug I've Fixed:** A race condition caused by physical network latency in a fuel ATM during a rainstorm. 
* **Management Philosophy:** "If you have to be a hero to ship the release, the process is broken."
* I’m fascinated by incentives, decision-making, and how people behave under pressure

Leadership, to me, is applied psychology at scale.

### 🛠️ The Toolkit
*I believe in choosing the right tool for the job, but these are my daily drivers:*

| **Core Backend** | **Frontend & Mobile** | **Infrastructure** | **Data & Edge** |

**🏛️ Architecture & Domain Focus:** Event-driven systems • Distributed architectures • ERP

*But more than tools, I enjoy solving problems where software meets messy real life.*

---

### 🌱 What I’m Exploring
* Engineering Manager / Senior EM / Solution Architect roles
* Technical leadership, preferably in climate-tech or financial inclusion
* Platform architecture at meaningful scale
* Global teams solving non-trivial problems
